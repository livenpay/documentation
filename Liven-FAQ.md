# LivenPay FAQ

## What is Liven?
Liven is a mobile wallet and payment network that rewards you for doing the things you love. Every time you spend with Liven, you earn LVN - A universal digital currency of dollar value rewards credit. You can spend your LVN at any partner venue, save it up for future, send it to others in the network or pass it on to charity.

## What does Liven stand for?
Liven isn’t an acronym, it’s a word, and it’s not pronounced livin’, it’s pronounced Lye-ven. We stand for good food, drink, charitable giving and better ways to interact with money.

## Do I need to pay to access Liven?
Nope, using the app costs nothing, paying your bills with Liven comes at no extra cost and on every transaction you’ll also earn Liven’s digital currency LivenCoin (LVN).

## How do I get Liven?
Liven is available for download from the Apple Appstore for iPhone and the Google Playstore for Android. You will require at least version 9 of iOS to use Liven on your iPhone, or Android 5.0 devices for Android. A 3G or higher data connection is recommended.

## What’s contained in the 5.5 update?
The Liven wallet has been updated and Liven Cash has been converted into LVN. Users can create their usernames and send LVN to each other. Users can also top up their LVN within the Liven wallet. LVN will be locked to Liven wallets until the completion of the public sale. You can read more about the 5.5 update **here.** 

## How does Liven make money?
Liven receives compensation in exchange for the marketing and exposure we provide to our merchant partners. Our merchant agreements are such that value is gained for both parties, this often means Liven transactions come with a commission percentage per successful transaction. Every Liven transaction itself increases the value of the Liven network and the LVN token, meaning the value of Liven’s reserve holdings increases, this is a form of ‘making money’. Our goals are to increase the value of our ecosystem of lifestyle spending.

# LivenPay

## What is Liven Pay and how do I use it?
Liven Pay is the cashless payment system that allows users to pay their bills directly through the Liven app. After linking your credit/debit card to your account, you simply use the Liven app to pay your bill by tapping “Pay now”.

## What is LVN?
LVN is Liven’s network utility currency. LVN is stored within your Liven wallet and can be used for lifestyle payments at over a thousand venues. If you don’t feel like spending it, feel free to store it in your wallet, send it to others or pass it on to charity.

## What happened to Liven Cash?
Liven Cash is dead, gone forever - we’ll miss its cash-ness and its 1 for 1 dollar value-ness. But all good things must come to an end, or be super-ceded by a cryptographic token. Jokes aside, Liven Cash was great, but it was pegged to the Australian dollar, which means it would be difficult to take overseas and deal with exchange rates. Instead, we decided to implement LivenCoin (LVN), which is a borderless virtual currency - meaning if you earn 700 LVN on a burger in New York, you can use that LVN for some pho in Melbourne, this wasn’t feasible with Liven Cash.


## Why do I have to verify both my phone number and email to use the app?/I don’t want to have to enter my phone number and email, can I still use the app?
Verification is important for us as it helps us ensure your account is secure and safe from third party interference. This ensures all your hard earned LVN is kept safe and secure in your Liven Wallet.

## How do I spend my LVN?
Before tapping “Pay Now” at a Liven venue, toggle the “Use Liven Cash” button to On. Then, just tap “Pay Now”. If you don’t have enough LVN to pay for the entire bill, the app will use your LVN and your linked debit/credit card will be charged the remainder.

## Can I still use Liven Pay and get LVN if I don’t have a credit or debit card?
We’re afraid not. In order to use Liven Pay, and earn or spend LVN, you must have a valid credit/debit card linked to your account. A debit Mastercard or Visa will work. To learn how to add payment details to your Liven account please refer to the Account FAQ below.

## Can I use the LVN I’ve earned from a transaction, to pay for that same transaction?
Not quite, LVN is only accumulated upon completion of the transaction. You will be able to use the LVN earned towards your next Liven transaction at the same venue, or any Liven partner venue.

## I tried to pay the bill with Liven Pay but the transaction was declined, what went wrong?
If your Liven Pay transaction has been declined, there are likely insufficient funds available from the payment method linked to your Liven account. To complete the transaction, you will need to add new payment details to your Liven account (please refer to Account FAQ to find out how). If you’re certain this was not the case, check your internet access, location service settings, or Wi-fi function. If none of these work, consider reporting faulty merchant equipment to us.

## Do I need an internet connection to use Liven?
Yes, you will require an active connection at the time you wish to pay your bill in order to connect to our servers. Phone number verification is also required for some venues and special promotions. We recommend a 3G or higher data plan.

## How can I sign up my favourite venue to accept Liven?
Get them to fill out our restaurant opt in form below and they can apply to join Liven!
[www.liven.com.au/merchant.html#partner](http://www.liven.com.au/merchant.html#partner) 

## How can I tell if a venue accepts LivenPay or not?
Keep a look out for the pink Liven sticker that can often be found stuck on store windows, this means that the venue you’re at accepts Liven Pay. All venues that are properly setup to accept Liven Pay will also have a button at the bottom of their profile saying “Pay Now”.  

## Why did this merchant leave?
Unfortunately not all brand partnerships work out all the time, partnership agreements require time and effort from both Liven and the merchant - occasionally these requirements are not met and merchants will leave or be removed from the network. These merchants are not restricted from joining the Liven network in future.

## How do I report a bug in the Liven app?
Contact us via the App’s in-built “Send us feedback” feature or by email to support@liven.com.au.

# Refer & Earn

## What is Liven’s Refer & Earn program?
‘Refer & Earn’ rewards you for sharing the love and telling your mates about Liven. When you share your unique referral code with a friend who hasn’t used Liven before, they will be given LVN to use right away and you’ll also be given LVN once your referral has made a successful purchase.

## How do I find my referral code?
Open the Liven app and and press the Profile button in the bottom right corner. Once in the Profile menu, tap “Give LVN, Get LVN” to view the Refer & Earn screen. Your referral code will be displayed at the bottom of the screen here. This code is unique to your account, and can be used to refer an unlimited number of friends, family or anyone else!

## I’ve been referred, how do I enter my friend’s referral code?
Once you’ve downloaded the app and verified your account, open the profile menu by tapping the icon on the bottom right of the screen, then tap “Add Promo code” from the menu options. Enter your friend’s referral code here and press apply to have referral credit used on your first purchase.

## I referred a friend, when do I get my LVN reward?
You will have your LVN added to your account once your referred friend uses Liven to pay at any partner venue.


# Liven Love (Donations)

## What is Liven Love?
Liven Love is a feature of Liven which allows users to share the LVN they receive (in whole or in part) with a variety of Australian charities, directly via the app if they choose to.

## Are my Liven Love donations tax-deductible?
Yes. All Liven Love donations above the value of AUD $2.00 are tax deductible.

## Will I get a tax receipt for my Liven Love donation?
Yes, a receipt for any Liven Love donation is emailed to the user within 7 days of the transaction (with the exception of beyondblue and OzHarvest, who issue their own tax receipts directly to users).

# Liven Account

## How do I add payment details to my Liven account?
To add payment details to your Liven account, choose ‘Payment Method’ from the apps Wallet menu, then click the ‘Add New Card’ button and follow the instructions.

## My credit/debit card was declined by the application, what should I do?
Cards can be declined for a number of reasons, not limited to the following: incorrectly typed card details, expired card, issues with foreign or non-Australian issued cards. If your card is declined, we recommend that you try once more to enter the details and if the issue persists, try using a different card. Following this, you should contact your bank or card issuer and inform them you are having issues with registering for online payment services.

## Why do I need to enable my GPS Location for the Liven app?
It is important to enable your GPS Location for the Liven app so that we can establish a secure connection between your device and our Liven Merchant’s POS systems. Without your GPS Location enabled, we can’t verify your proximity to the merchant, so you can’t enjoy cashless payment of the bill via Liven Pay, earn LVN on your transactions, or view which Liven Merchants are nearby.

## How do I change the email address linked to my Liven account?
Please contact us at support@liven.com.au to change the email address linked to your Liven account.

## How do I change the mobile phone number linked to my Liven account?
Please contact us at support@liven.com.au to change the phone number linked to your Liven account.

## How do I reset my Liven password?

## I’m having trouble logging in to Liven with my email address
Please contact us at support@liven.com.au from the email address you used to create your Liven account.

## I’ve got a promo code, how do I use it?
Once you’ve downloaded the app and verified your account, open the profile menu by tapping the icon on the bottom right of the screen, then tap “Add Promo code” from the menu options. Enter your promo code here and press apply to be instantly credited with the promo code’s value.

# LivenCoin (LVN)

## What is LVN?
LivenCoin (LVN) is Liven’s network utility currency. LVN is built on the Ethereum blockchain under the ERC20 token standard.

## Where can I hold my LVN?
Since LVN is an Ethereum ERC token, LVN can be stored in any Ethereum wallet, or, unique to LVN, in the Liven Wallet. For ease of use we recommend keeping LVN in your in-app Liven Wallet, where it benefits from it’s unique design and can be sent and received free and instantly, used to transact at venues, or donated to charity.

## Where can I send my LVN?
You can send your LVN to others within the Liven network using @username handles, or to any Ethereum address with the ‘withdraw’ interface. Withdrawal is not available for existing LVN holders until completion of the public token sale.

## What can I do with LVN?
LVN can be used as a payment method at over a thousand merchants, sent to others in the network and also donated to charities - otherwise, you can hold it and eventually take it to exchanges for sale.

## What are my payment options with the introduction of LVN?
To pay for your bill with Liven, you can use your linked debit/credit card, or LVN. If you don’t have enough LVN to pay for the bill in full, you can use your LVN and the remainder will be billed to your debit card. *(or perhaps you’re lucky enough to find a promo code - WhatTheFAQ5)* 

## I want to buy LVN how can I buy it?
You can buy LVN in the Liven app or through the Token Sale dashboard available on livenpay.io. If you intend on making a contribution greater than $500 AUD, please refer to the dashboard.

## How much is LVN worth currently?
Until the LVN coins are minted and the dynamic exchange rate is active, we will not know the exact value of LVN. However, we approximate the internal spending power of each LVN token to be worth 1.5-2 cents on launch day. The value of LVN internally within the Liven network compared to external markets will differ. LVN’s internal value will be determined by the dynamic Reward Protocol. LVN’s external value will be determined by external market forces of supply and demand - How the internal price of LVN is insulated from external market fluctuations can be read in detail in the white paper.

## Will the value of the LVN change?
If you use Liven as a customer, the in-app value of LVN is currently frozen at $AU0.02 per LVN token, this is until we unlock tokens for withdrawal and the reward protocol is launched.
The market value of LVN is set by supply and demand factors, and we can't guarantee any present or future value of LVN on external markets.
This update, however, is a great step forward for our product both in the blockchain space and for our existing consumer facing business, and making a better product for our customers is always beneficial to the growth of our business.
It will go up as 

## Where can I spend my LVN? 
You can spend your LVN at any of our partnered venues. You can find all our venues in-app or on our website at: [https://www.liven.com.au](https://www.liven.com.au/melbourne/all/)

## Can I sell my LVN?
Once LVN is distributed to wallets, and made publicly tradable, you will be able to buy it, sell it, or trade it for something else - until then, buy yourself a pizza and HODL.
This feature will not be available if you are unable to provide identification sufficient to pass an anti money laundering check.

## Will I still be able to use fiat to pay?
Yes of course! All Liven merchants will still accept fiat currency and you can pay using your credit/debit card via the app (and earn more LVN).

## Is LVN a food exclusive currency?
LVN can be spent at any one of our partnered merchants. Although the Liven network consists mainly of food venues, you will see other lifestyle merchants and businesses that accept LVN. LVN started with, and is marketed as a food currency, but the LivenPay gateway and ecosystem is open to all kinds of retailers and merchant partners, and as time goes on, wider verticals and selections will be made available. You can find the list of all our partnered venues here: [https://www.liven.com.au](https://www.liven.com.au/melbourne/all/)

## What is ERC-20/What is Ethereum?
Ethereum is a smart-contract platform built with blockchain technology. Smart contracts on Ethereum can be developed in a programming language called Solidity and used to launch applications and tokens. ERC is a token contract which acts as a template for launching tokens on the Ethereum blockchain. Liven will be launching LivenCoin (LVN) under the ERC20 token contract.

# LVN Token Sale

For information and questions around the token sale, please view our [Help-desk](https://help.liven.com.au/buying-lvn-token-sale-dashboard).

# LVN (Technical)

## What is a whitepaper?
Whitepapers should aim to inform the reader of everything you need to know before deciding to contribute to the project or technology. This should include the project’s vision and how it intends to achieving that vision. In the case of cryptocurrencies, you’ll also find information about token distribution and tokenomics.

## What is your token strategy?
Out of the 10 Billion LVN Tokens generated, 30% will remain in the reward cache to be released to users as rewards. 30% will be made available for sale, 15% will be kept as Reserve Tokens and 25% kept as Incentive Tokens. The Reserve and Incentive Tokens will be split amongst: existing staff (5%), new staff (5%), advisors (2%), referral programs (2%), partnerships (8%) and the bounty program (2%). Read more in the white paper available for download at livenpay.io

## What is the total supply of LVN?
The total supply of LVN is 10 billion tokens.

## What problem(s) is LVN addressing?
This question is answered extensively in the first section of the whitepaper, but here’s the TLDR; 
LVN is addressing 2 main problems. The first is related to mainstream cryptocurrency adoption, which is obstructed by market volatility, absence of consumer centric use cases and poor user experience. The second is related to fragmented loyalty and incentive schemes within the lifestyle goods & services industry. Addressing the problems in retail loyalty models with a blockchain solution not only revolutionises borderless spending, but brings cryptocurrency to the mainstream in a practical user-friendly way.

## How will you control the price of LVN to maintain stability?
The Reward Protocol is the key economic framework at the core of the LivenPay Project and the LVN token. The reward protocol manages economic liability and mitigates the extreme market volatility suffered by many contemporary token payment projects. The Reward Protocol enables Liven to actually receive payments in LVN at a value that cannot be manipulated by aggressive market behaviour for short term gain by funds or high net worth individuals. The White Paper provides a more detailed explanation of the Reward Protocol. You can find and read the White Paper here: [https://livenpay.io/](https://livenpay.io/) 

## What will you do with the money raised from the Token Sale?
For full details of Use of Funds refer to the White Paper.
Money raised from the Token Sale will be mainly put towards the Token Redemption Liability Reserve, Product Development, and expansion of the LivenPay ecosystem. The Token Redemption Liability Reserve serves to cover the short-term costs of reimbursing merchants in fiat currency should LVN Tokens be redeemed at the venues. The rest of the funds will be distributed across the following: the Business Development Team, Operations Team, PR & Marketing Team, Merchant Network, Expansion Costs, Direct User Acquisition Costs, General Marketing Costs, Occupancy Costs and Other Misc Costs.

## Will I need a private key to be able to spend my LVN?
No, you will not need a private key to spend LVN. Simply login into the Liven app and pay via the app as usual. 

## Will I need a wallet/public key to receive LVN?
Nope, LVN can be received with your in-app wallet or your public ERC compatible wallet address.

## What is a Private Key?
A private key is a sophisticated form of cryptography that enables users to access their cryptocurrency. A private key is a fundamental element of cryptocurrency transactions, and acts as a security mechanism to protect users from theft and unauthorised access to funds.

## What is ROI?
Return on Investment (ROI) is a performance metric that is used to evaluate the efficiency of an investment. 

## Can I store LVN on a hardware wallet?
Yes, many Ethereum compatible hard wallets are capable of storing ERC20 tokens like LVN.

## What exchanges are you listed on?
We are currently in negotiation with a number of major exchanges. Nothing can be confirmed until the completion of the token sale, however we're committed to enabling public access for our users to be able to trade and purchase LVN freely. You can keep updated with any announcements we make on our website livenpay.io or our Telegram channel: [https://t.me/livenpay](https://t.me/livenpay) 

## What is the KYC procedure?
All participants of the token sale will be subject to Know Your Client (KYC) and Anti-Money-Laundering (AML) checks by Liven. These checks will establish the identity and residency of all contributors, and will require contributors to submit identification documents. Contributors who fail the KYC checks will be forbidden from taking part in the Token Sale (any contributions already made will be refunded).

## When should I pass the KYC procedure?
You can pass the KYC procedure at any time before taking part in the Token Sale.
